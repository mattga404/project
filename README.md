ðŸ‘‹ I am trying to create a simple SPA with CRUD functionality.
The code inside of the folder, "WorkingSPA" has been tested and works perfectly. When the 'About' link is clicked on in the side navigation bar, it successfully populatesSQL table data upon page load, and then allows the user to update the data and push the changes back through to the table.

I now have a completely separate working code that is more for aesthetics, "SiteTemplate".

I cannot figure out how to merge the two to where I can have the appearance of the Site in "SiteTemplate", along with the functionality of the hamburger and responsiveness of the side navigation menu, but being able to select a given links within - let's use "#Items", for example, and have the exact same functionality as what's in the "WorkingSPA" code, where the table of items will auto populate upon page load and then let the user create, delete, add, items to the table with the Submit button.

The Session file references can be disregarded as I have no issues with this code so I left it out of the project files.
